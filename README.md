DEVELOPMENT TOOLS:-
1. Web Browser: We can use Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge to run this application.
2. Html, CSS, JavaScript: As a web developer, the three main languages we use to build websites areHTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
JavaScript is the programming language, we use HTML to structure the site, and we use CSS to design and layout the web page.
These days, CSS has become more than just a design language, though. You can actually implement animations and smooth transitions with just CSS.
3. ASP.NET Using C#: ASP.NET is a web application framework developed and marketed by Microsoft to allow programmers to build dynamic web sites. It allows you to use a full featured programming language such as C# or VB.NET to build web applications easily.
4. Back End Tool SQL SERVER: Microsoft SQL Server 2014 is free and contains feature-rich editions of SQL Server that are ideal for learning, developing, powering desktop, web & small server applications, and for redistribution by ISVs. The SQL Server 2014 release includes the full version of SQL Server 2014 Management Studio.

Our designed online shopping system provides a 24×7 service, that is customers can surf the website, place orders anytime they wish to. Also, the delivery system works 24×7 hours a week. Some of the features that can be modified and added to this system in the future involve its implementation by local shopkeepers, where shops will be providing an online interface to customers for shopping and placing orders.
Then some delivery persons can perform their work. This will be adding on benefit for the customers as it will save their time, plus it adds on for the shopkeepers also, as people will continue to shop from local shops rather than preferring to supermarkets every time.
Also, since the deliveries from these local vendors will not be as time-consuming as these days Flipkart, Amazon, etc. take but rather will be delivered the same day of an order placed. Else the shopkeeper can ask the customer that the product will be available by the next day, so if he/she still wants to place the order, it can be done.
Again, return or exchange will be easy since the delivery boy can even do it as the store is nearby. Including a chat box for public benefit is also a great idea via which people can directly have a conversation with some officials regarding any type of queries.
